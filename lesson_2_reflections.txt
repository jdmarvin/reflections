What happens when you initialize a repository?
creates a .git file.

Why do you need a .git file?
It tracks the meta data for all the commits and info
for your Git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository?
The staging area is a holding directory for your commits.
It provides a place to represent the working 
directory files you would like to commit to the
repository

What value do you think the Staging Area offers?
It gives you a place to combine/choose your files so
if you make a logical change to two files but 
not to the other ones the staging area allows you to
combine only what is relevant.
